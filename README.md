# Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a movie recommendation system built using three different models: Popularity-Based, Content-Based, and Collaborative Filtering.

Description
The movie recommendation system is designed to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on different approaches:

Popularity-Based Recommender System: This model recommends movies based on their overall popularity or highest ratings. It provides recommendations that are popular among all users.

Content-Based Recommender System: This model recommends movies based on their content or attributes. It suggests movies similar to the ones a user has previously liked or interacted with, considering features such as genre, actors, or directors.

Collaborative Filtering: This model recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users or similar movies. It utilizes user-item interaction data to identify patterns and suggest movies that users with similar tastes have enjoyed.

Features
Movie recommendation using multiple models: Popularity-Based, Content-Based, and Collaborative Filtering.
Personalized recommendations based on user preferences, movie attributes, and collaborative patterns.

Dataset
The recommendation system utilizes a movie dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consists of two CSV files:

movies.csv: This file contains information about movies, including movie titles, genres, and other attributes.

ratings.csv: This file contains user ratings for the movies, including the user ID, movie ID, rating, and timestamp.
